                        They took a domestic flight from Mumbai to Chennai inside India and then an International flight
                        from Chennai to Singapore.

                        Chennai Airport ( (IATA: MAA, ICAO: VOMM) is 3rd busiest Airport in India, handling more than 22
                        million passengers annually.

                        Chennai Airport formerly called Madras Airport before the city name changed in 1996; hence the
                        Chennai Airport code is MAA (MAdrAs).<br /><br />

                        Customs facility used for International Arrivals.

                        New Terminal 4 building is currently in use for International departures. Both Terminal 3 and 4

                    <p><b>Pre-Paid Taxi at Chennai Airport :</b><br/>
                        Usually, Prepaid Taxis are a convenient and economical way to get to your hotel from the
                        Chennai
                        airport.
                        Make sure that if you choose to take a taxi, only get a prepaid taxi from one of the
                        counters at the
                        Arrival lobby.
                        To catch a regular "Black and Yellow" taxi, just walk up to one of the Pre-Paid counter
                        inside the
                        arrival lobby, tell them your destination.
                        Pre-Paid Taxi counter will let you know the fare.
                        You can Pay for your taxi by cash or credit card.
                        Usually, the black and yellow taxi cab’s (Pre-Paid Counter) credit card machine is “broken”
                        most of the
                        time.
                        Other private Cars counters accept Credit Card, however, their charges are a little bit
                        higher.
                        Once you pay, then the counter attendant will give you a receipt with a taxi number and will
                        tell you
                        where to catch your taxi.
                        If you don't see the taxi number on the receipt then ask the counter attendant.
                        Not all Black and Yellow top (Pre-paid) taxis are air-conditioned, so ask for
                        Air-conditioned taxis in
                        summer or daytime.
                        Please note Ride App Cars and private rental cars have air conditioning.
                        We recommend a car with air conditioning if you are coming from an International
                        flight.
                        Check before you pay for your taxi at the Pre-paid counter.
                        To get to your black and yellow cab at Chennai Airport after making payment and receiving
                        receipt:
                        - follow the prepaid taxi signs,
                        - exit the arrival hall, and
                        - walk to the taxi cue attendant opposite to the Terminal in the parking lot area at Chennai
                        Airport,
                        - Show the attendant your receipt and he will direct you to your taxi.
                        Make sure you hold onto the receipt until you safely reach your hotel or destination.
                        The Receipt is to be handed to the driver at the END of the trip.
                        The driver requires the receipt to get paid by the taxi office.</p>

                        Airport.
                        We recommend taking Ride-App Cars for comfort in Chennai as they are Air-conditioned.
                        They are fitted with GPS technology and are much easier to track.
                        The fare is based on distance per kilometer. Ride-App cars are available 24x7 at Chennai
                        Airport.

                    <p><b>Hotel Pickup at Chennai Airport :</b><br />
                        Most big hotels in Chennai provide Airport pickup services for their guest for an additional
                        charge.
                        Usually, it is more expensive more than a PrePaid Taxi and Ride-App cars but is very safe.
                        Check with your hotel for Airport pickup service options.
                        Usually, Look for your name when entering the open-air arrival hall which is the major hotel
                        pick-up spot.
                       Hotels in Chennai will also let you know the pickup location in the Arrival halls.
